<blockquote>
  <p>When redesigning my <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a> in 2023 I chose to completely start over. So this represents the 2023 version of my website onward.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What exactly is it?</h2>

<p>The previous version had projects I could showcase, but they were from years past, so in the redesign I chose to streamline to just the information:</p>
<div class="halfs">
  <div class="col center">
    Previous Version
    <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/cap-2017.jpg" alt="Portfolio" />
  </div>
  <div class="col center">
    Current Version
    <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/cap-2023.jpg" alt="Current" />
  </div>
</div>
