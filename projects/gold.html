<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> the current status of the development is <strong>smack dab in the middle</strong> (insert 1999 under construction gif here). Some features aren't complete, content is a little sparse, and there's some buggy aspects still floating around, but it's getting there.</p>

<h2>What exactly is it?</h2>

<div class="halfs">
  <div class="col">
    <p>Technology stops for no man or woman. I've found that part of being a web developer inherently involves dabbling in new things, taking what you know from solution A and seeing if solution B needs something else.</p>
    <p>A few years back I was starting to write some of my thoughts on various technologies down. This could have just been a list of notes on my computer some where, but I also had some time and interest in getting my hands dirty in a few new (to me) technologies.</p>

<p>More recently I found myself in a similar place, wanting to have a project where I could dive into <a href="#">React</a>. So my note keeper project got a whole new iteration. After some more intentional rebranding and design, I completely started fresh on the code:</p>

<div class="halfs">
  <div class="col center">
    <p>Original

    <p>Current

  </div>
