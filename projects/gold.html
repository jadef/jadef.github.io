  <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong><br />
  The current status of the development is <strong>smack dab in the middle</strong> (insert 1999 under construction gif here). Some features aren't complete, content is a little sparse, and there's some buggy aspects still floating around, but it's getting there.</p>

<h2>What exactly is it?</h2>

<div class="halfs">
  <div class="col">
    <p>Technology stops for no one. I've found that part of being a web developer inherently involves dabbling in new things, taking what you know from <em>solution A</em> and seeing if <em>solution B</em> needs something else.</p>
    <p>A few years back I was starting to write down some of my thoughts on various technologies, languages, libraries, etc. This could have just been a list of notes on my computer some where, but I also had some time and interest in getting my hands dirty in a few new (to me) technologies.</p>

<p>More recently I found myself in a similar place, wanting to have a project where I could dive into <a href="#">React</a>. So my note keeper project got a whole new iteration. After some more intentional rebranding and design, I completely started fresh on the code.</p>

<p>Content-wise, the notes are completely personal thoughts at the time of writing. They're opinionated, and very possibly inaccurate, but a helpful way for me to keep tabs on the different things that I've come across.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<h4>Important aspects</h4>
<p><strong>React</strong></p>
<p>The important part of this iteration was to build a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> based single page web app. So it has everything you'd expect from that, most notably the component based <a href="https://github.com/jadef/gold-miner#structure">structure</a>.</p>
<p>File formats are <code>.jsx</code> to take advantage of the inline syntax that offers. Also taking advantage of next generation JavaScript is achieved through the use of <a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, notably with <code>"presets": ["es2015", "react", "stage-2"]</code>.</p>
<p>A few other notes on React is the declaration of <code>Prop Types</code> and using <code>states</code> when appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Webpack</strong></p>
<p>Original development was driven through the gulp task runner and browserify for the app bundler. Both those have been scrapped in favor of using <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>.</p>
<p>A simple yarn script starts a middlewhere instance (in memory) so that any dev changes triggers hot reloading of component or sass changes negating full reloads.</p>

<p><strong>Sass</strong></p>
<p>The CSS builds from <code>.scss</code> files organized into tiers of <code>Variables > Elements > Sections > Components</code> (with a <code>Vendor</code> folder thrown in there).</p>
<p>An important organizational difference is that the section and component level of Sass files are included right in the corresponding jsx file. See the <a href="https://github.com/jadef/gold-miner#structure">Structure section</a> of the readme for a visual representation of this relationship.</p>
<p>Responsive behavior is achieved through a primarily flexbox based structure as well as a mobile first approach.</p>

<h4>Other things of note</h4>
<ul>
  <li>BrowserSync integrated for server reload/browser testing.</li>
  <li>Yarn recommended over npm for package control (there's a yarn lock file included).</li>
  <li>JavaScript linting (eslint) implemented with <code>"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"]</code> as the primary rule sets.</li>
  <li>Sass linting (stylelint) implemented with <code>"extends": "stylelint-config-standard"</code> as the primary rule set.</li>
  <li>Snap.svg used for svg animation/manipulation</li>
</ul>

  <div class="col">
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A <em>Useful</em> tool</li>
      <li>Intentional functions with interactivity</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Needs smarter data storage</li>
      <li>Content add/update needs to be stupid simple</li>
      <li>Not test-drive development</li>
    </ul>
